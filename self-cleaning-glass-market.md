<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-Cleaning Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophilic Coatings</li><li>Hydrophobic Coatings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The self-cleaning glass market is primarily categorized into two types: hydrophilic and hydrophobic coatings. Hydrophilic coatings attract water, causing it to spread out and wash away dirt and debris when it rains. This property enhances the cleaning effect as water forms a thin layer that removes contaminants. Conversely, hydrophobic coatings repel water, causing it to bead and roll off the surface, effectively carrying away dirt and grime. Both types offer significant advantages for maintaining cleanliness and reducing maintenance efforts in various applications.</p></p>
