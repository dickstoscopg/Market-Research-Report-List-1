<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Toric Intraocular Lens IOLs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Not Pre-loaded IOLs</li><li>Pre-loaded IOLs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Toric Intraocular Lens (IOL) market is divided into two main types: Not Pre-loaded IOLs and Pre-loaded IOLs. Not Pre-loaded IOLs require surgeons to manually load the lens into an injector before implantation, offering flexibility in lens choice but demanding more skill and time during surgery. In contrast, Pre-loaded IOLs come ready-to-use within an injector, simplifying the surgical process and reducing the risk of handling errors. This distinction influences both adoption rates and surgical efficiency in cataract procedures.</p></p>
